alessandrocornacchia: bash: ./venv/bin/activate: Permission denied #terminalLastCommand 

Terminal: # Virtual Environment Activation Error

You're getting a permission denied error because you're trying to execute the activation script directly instead of sourcing it.

## Correct way to activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Or the shorthand version:

```bash
. venv/bin/activate
```

After activating, you can install requirements and run the Flask app as mentioned in your README:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FLASK_APP=server.py && flask run
```

If the virtual environment doesn't exist yet, create it first:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

alessandrocornacchia:  I want to mount in #file:Dockerfile.debug the current folder so that if I make changes to the code I do not have to restart the contsainer. I will run flask in debug mode. How can I achieev that? #file:start.sh is invoked at container, if I mount a volume with the app code, does it work?

Workspace: Collecting workspace information# Docker Development Environment Setup

To mount your local code directory into the container and enable hot reloading with Flask in debug mode, you need to modify both your Dockerfile.debug and how you run the container.

## Modify Dockerfile.debug

```dockerfile
# Base image
FROM python:3.9-slim AS base

# Install dependencies including SSH client
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    entr \
    openssh-client \
    git \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy scripts
COPY on-rsvp-change.sh /app/on-rsvp-change.sh
COPY rest-db-watch.sh /app/rest-db-watch.sh
COPY start.sh /app/start.sh

# Create directory for code mounting
RUN mkdir -p /app/webapp

# Make scripts executable
RUN chmod +x /app/*.sh

# Expose port for the web application
EXPOSE 80

# Start services
CMD ["/app/start.sh"]
```

## Modify start.sh for Development Mode

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Install requirements if they don't exist (first run)
cd /app/webapp
if [ ! -d ./.venv ]; then
    python -m venv .venv
    . .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install gunicorn
else
    . .venv/bin/activate
fi

# Start the webapp in the background with Flask's development server
export FLASK_APP=server.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 &

# Start the file watcher
WORDKDIR=$(dirname $0)
echo "Listening for changes to database: $WORDKDIR/webapp/.data/reservations.csv"
mkdir -p $WORDKDIR/webapp/.data
touch $WORDKDIR/webapp/.data/reservations.csv
ls $WORDKDIR/webapp/.data/reservations.csv | entr -spn "$WORDKDIR/on-rsvp-change.sh > ./rsvp-change.log 2>&1"
```

## Running the Container

Build and run the container with volume mounting:

```sh
# Build the image
docker build -f deploy/docker/Dockerfile.debug -t tofino-rsvp-debug .

# Run with volume mount
docker run -p 8080:80 -v $(pwd):/app/webapp --name tofino-rsvp-debug tofino-rsvp-debug
```

This setup:
1. Mounts your current directory to `/app/webapp` in the container
2. Uses Flask's development server instead of gunicorn for better hot reloading
3. Installs requirements on first run
4. Exposes the app on port 8080 on your host machine

With this configuration, any changes you make to your local files will be immediately reflected in the running container, and Flask's debug mode will reload the application when code changes are detected.

alessandrocornacchia: #file:Dockerfile.debug:15-15 do I need absolute path /app  here?

GitHub Copilot: # Regarding the Docker COPY Path

Since you've already defined `WORKDIR /app` earlier in your Dockerfile, you don't need to specify the absolute path app in the COPY command. You can use a relative path instead:

```dockerfile
COPY ${DIR}/app/requirements.txt .
```

Both forms will work correctly:
- Using app (absolute path) is explicit but redundant
- Using `.` (relative path) is more concise and follows Docker best practices

The relative path works because Docker interprets paths relative to the current working directory set by the most recent `WORKDIR` directive.

For consistency, I recommend using the relative path, especially if you're planning to mount your code directory as a volume for development.

alessandrocornacchia: if I specify build context in docker compose, which path should I use in copy? relative to what?

GitHub Copilot: # Docker Build Context and COPY Paths

When you specify a build context in Docker Compose, **all COPY commands in your Dockerfile are relative to that build context**, not relative to the Dockerfile location.

## How It Works

In a typical docker-compose.yml file:

```yaml
services:
  webapp:
    build:
      context: .  # This is your build context
      dockerfile: deploy/docker/Dockerfile.debug
```

The current line in your Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
COPY ../../requirements.txt .
```

This is likely incorrect because the paths in COPY are always relative to the build context, not to where the Dockerfile is located.

## Correct Usage

If your requirements.txt is in the project root and your build context is also the project root:

```dockerfile
COPY requirements.txt .
```

If your Dockerfile is in docker but your build context is the project root:

```dockerfile
# This is correct regardless of where the Dockerfile is located
COPY requirements.txt .
```

The key principle: **COPY paths are always relative to the build context**, regardless of where your Dockerfile is located within your project structure.

alessandrocornacchia: context: /home/alessandro/dev/tofino-rsvp-webapp/deploy/docker
this is my context and requirements is in /home/alessandro/dev/tofino-rsvp-webapp/

GitHub Copilot: # Corrected Dockerfile COPY Paths

Based on your build context at docker and requirements.txt being in the project root, you need to update your COPY command:

```dockerfile
COPY ../requirements.txt /app
```

The relative path `../` navigates up one directory level from your context directory to find requirements.txt in the project root.

Additionally, your CMD statement may need adjustment since it's looking for start.sh in a path that might not exist after container build:

```dockerfile
# Copy the start script to the container
COPY ./start.sh /app/start.sh

# Make it executable
RUN chmod +x /app/start.sh

# Execute with proper path
CMD ["/app/start.sh"]
```

This assumes start.sh is in the same directory as your Dockerfile.debug.

## Alternative: Change Build Context

For simpler paths, you could also set your build context to the project root in docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
services:
  webapp:
    build:
      context: ..
      dockerfile: deploy/docker/Dockerfile.debug
```

Then use:
```dockerfile
COPY requirements.txt /app


alessandrocornacchia: edit #file:list.html:47-47  I want the text outside of the button

GitHub Copilot: I'll modify the template to move the priority text outside the button while maintaining the toggle functionality:

```html
<i class="fa fa-arrow-down"></i> <span class="ml-1">High Priority</span>
```

To implement this properly in context, here's how to revise the entire priority toggle button section:

```html
<form method="post" action="{{ url_for('toggle_priority') }}" class="d-inline">
    <input type="hidden" name="reservation_id" value="{{ rsvp.id }}">
    <input type="hidden" name="username" value="{{ selected_username }}">
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-sm {% if rsvp.high_priority %}btn-danger{% else %}btn-secondary{% endif %}" 
            style="width:auto;">
        <i class="fa fa-arrow-down"></i>
    </button>
    <span class="ml-2 {% if rsvp.high_priority %}text-danger{% else %}text-secondary{% endif %}">
        {% if rsvp.high_priority %}High Priority{% else %}Low Priority{% endif %}
    </span>
</form>
```

This change places just the icon in the button, with the text appearing outside but next to it, while maintaining the appropriate styling for high/low priority.

alessandrocornacchia: actually, even a better idea, move the button to change priority under column "actions" and leave under "priority" only the text

GitHub Copilot: # Moving Priority Toggle to Actions Column

I'll modify the template to move the toggle button to the "Actions" column and leave just the status text in the "Priority" column:

```html
<!-- In the Priority column - Display only status -->
<td>
    <span class="badge {% if rsvp.high_priority %}badge-danger{% else %}badge-secondary{% endif %}">
        {% if rsvp.high_priority %}High Priority{% else %}Low Priority{% endif %}
    </span>
</td>
<!-- In the Actions column - Add toggle button for admins -->
<td>
    {% if session.admin_logged_in %}
    <form method="post" action="{{ url_for('toggle_priority') }}" class="d-inline mr-1">
        <input type="hidden" name="reservation_id" value="{{ rsvp.id }}">
        <input type="hidden" name="username" value="{{ selected_username }}">
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-sm {% if rsvp.high_priority %}btn-outline-danger{% else %}btn-outline-secondary{% endif %}">
            <i class="fa fa-{% if rsvp.high_priority %}arrow-down{% else %}arrow-up{% endif %}"></i>
            Toggle Priority
        </button>
    </form>
    
    <form method="post" action="{{ url_for('delete_reservation') }}" class="d-inline">
        <input type="hidden" name="reservation_id" value="{{ rsvp.id }}">
        <input type="hidden" name="username" value="{{ selected_username }}">
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-sm btn-danger" 
                onclick="return confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this reservation?')">
            <i class="fa fa-trash"></i> Delete
        </button>
    </form>
    {% endif %}
</td>
```

This change:
1. Simplifies the "Priority" column to show only status badges
2. Moves the toggle functionality to the "Actions" column 
3. Places the toggle button next to the delete button for admin users
4. Uses outline button style to differentiate it from the delete button

alessandrocornacchia: Merge #file:index.html:5-9 with #file:create.html  Add it to the top

GitHub Copilot: # Merged Welcome Section with Create Template

I'll modify the create.html template to incorporate the welcome section from the index page at the top:

```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
<div class="container vh-100">
    <!-- Welcome section from index.html -->
    <div class="h-50 d-flex align-items-center mb-4">
        <div class="container mh-100 text-center">
            <h1>Welcome to P4</h1>
            <p>Reserve your timeslot on our Tofino switches!</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- New "My Reservations" section, include list.html -->
    {% include 'list.html' %}
    
    <h1>{% block title %} Create new reservation {% endblock %}</h1>

    <!-- Rest of the create.html content remains unchanged -->
    <form method="post">
    <!-- ... existing form content ... -->
```

This change:

1. Adds the welcome section at the very top of the page
2. Preserves the original title block in create.html
3. Adds some margin (mb-4) to separate the welcome section from the reservation list
4. Keeps the container structure intact

The rest of the create.html template remains unchanged, maintaining all the existing functionality.

alessandrocornacchia: this gives me a large panel with lot of space around. Needs to be smaller

GitHub Copilot: # Compact Welcome Section for Create Page

Let's make the welcome section more compact with less space around it:

```html
<!-- Welcome section - more compact -->
<div class="d-flex align-items-center mb-2 py-2">
    <div class="text-center w-100">
        <h3>Welcome to P4</h3>
        <p class="mb-1">Reserve your timeslot on our Tofino switches!</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

This change:

1. Removes the `h-20` height class which was forcing extra space
2. Replaces the nested container with a simpler structure
3. Uses `mb-2` instead of `mb-4` for less bottom margin
4. Adds small vertical padding with `py-2` for a more compact look
5. Downgrades `h1` to `h3` to take up less vertical space
6. Uses `mb-1` on the paragraph to reduce space after it
7. Sets `w-100` to ensure proper width without the extra container

This should make the welcome section smaller and more compact while maintaining its centered text and positioning at the top of the page.

alessandrocornacchia: I change my mind. Just add some space on top of the page to separate the navbar more from the content

GitHub Copilot: # Adding More Space at the Top of the Page

Let's enhance the top spacing to better separate the navbar from the content:

```html
<div class="container vh-100">
    <!-- Increased top spacing -->
    <div class="mb-5" style="height: 3rem;"></div>
    
    <!-- New "My Reservations" section, inlcude list.hmtl -->
    {% include 'list.html' %}
```

This change:

1. Increases the height from `2rem` to `3rem` for more vertical space
2. Changes `mb-4` to `mb-5` for a larger bottom margin
3. Keeps the same structure but provides more spacing between the navbar and content

This should create a cleaner visual separation between your navigation bar and the reservation content area without changing the overall layout of the page.

alessandrocornacchia: Add margin below #file:create.html:82-132 

GitHub Copilot: # Adding Margin Below Active Reservations

To add margin below the active reservations section, I'll modify the code to include additional spacing:

```html
    {% if show_rsvp_button %}   
    <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-md-3">
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="modal"
                data-target="#exampleModal">
                <i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i> New reservation
            </button>
        </div>
    </div>
    {% endif %}
    
    <!-- Added spacing between reservations section and modal -->
    <div class="mb-5"></div>
```

This change adds a spacer div with Bootstrap's `mb-5` class (large bottom margin) after the active reservations section, regardless of whether the "New reservation" button is displayed. This will create visual separation between this section and the modal that follows it in the DOM.

alessandrocornacchia: how to add some bottom space at the bottom of the page 

GitHub Copilot: # Adding Bottom Space to the Page

To add bottom space at the end of your page, add a spacer div before the closing container div:

```html
    {% endif %}

    <!-- Add bottom spacing -->
    <div class="mb-5 pb-5"></div>

</div>
{% endblock %}
```

This implementation:
1. Uses `mb-5` for a large margin-bottom (3rem in Bootstrap)
2. Adds `pb-5` for additional padding-bottom (3rem)
3. Places the spacer after all content but before the container closes
4. Works whether or not the reservation section is shown

The extra space will create a more comfortable viewing experience by preventing content from sitting flush against the bottom of the viewport.

alessandrocornacchia: ok in #file:create.html make the entire section create reservation collapsible. User needs to click on the title to expand

GitHub Copilot: # Making Create Reservation Section Collapsible

I'll modify the create.html template to make the entire reservation creation form collapsible, with the title serving as the toggle:

alessandrocornacchia: okay. Now make more visible that is collapsible. Maybe use borders or colors around create new reservation...

GitHub Copilot: # Enhanced Collapsible Header for Create Reservation

I'll make the collapsible section more visually distinct by adding a card-like appearance with clearer interactive elements:

```html
<!-- Clickable heading that toggles the form - Enhanced visual design -->
<div class="card mb-4">
    <div class="card-header d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center py-3" 
         data-toggle="collapse" 
         data-target="#createReservationForm" 
         style="cursor: pointer; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #007bff;">
        <h3 class="mb-0">{% block title %} Create new reservation {% endblock %}</h3>
        <span class="badge badge-primary mr-2">Click to expand</span>
        <i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Collapsible form section - keep existing content -->
    <div class="collapse" id="createReservationForm">
        <div class="card-body border-top">
            <form method="post" action="{{ url_for('create') }}">
                <!-- ...existing form content... -->
```

This update:

1. Wraps the header in a Bootstrap card component for visual distinction
2. Adds a left border accent in blue to draw attention
3. Includes explicit "Click to expand" text with a badge
4. Uses a subtle background color for the header
5. Maintains the chevron icon for visual indicator
6. Keeps all the existing functionality

The card structure makes it immediately clear that this is a collapsible section, and the visual styling helps draw user attention to the interactive element.

alessandrocornacchia: I receive #terminalSelection when trying to run #file:on-rsvp-change.sh 

GitHub Copilot: # Shell Script Syntax Error

You're getting an "Unterminated quoted string" error in your on-rsvp-change.sh script. There are a couple of key issues:

## Issues in the Script

1. **Missing variable initialization**: The script checks `now >= from` but never defines the `from` variable
2. **Unterminated quotes**: In the AWK command with nested quotes for date formatting

## Fixed Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

###############################
# reads all reservations and uses the current time to determine
# which reservations are active, then it updates the authorized
# users file on the target machines. This script is triggered
# by the rest-db-watch.sh script whenever a change in the db
# is detected
###############################
echo "Running on-rsvp-change.sh script"
tail -n +2 ./.data/reservations.csv | awk -F, '{
    
    "date +%s" | getline now
    "date -d \"" $4 "\" +%s" | getline from
    "date -d \"" $5 "\" +%s" | getline to

    if (now <= to && now >= from) {
        target = $3 ".polito.it"
        print $2 "," to "," target
    }

}' | while read -r line; do
    # Continue with rest of script...
```

The key change is adding the missing `from` date calculation, assuming it's in the 4th field of your CSV.

## Ensuring Proper Shell

Make sure the script is executable and runs with bash:

```bash
chmod +x deploy/docker/on-rsvp-change.sh
```

This should resolve your syntax error. If the issue persists, check your CSV format to ensure it matches the field positions you're referencing.

GitHub Copilot: # Fixing the Shell Script Syntax Error

The script is showing a syntax error, likely due to the quoting in the AWK command. Let's fix this by simplifying the date handling and ensuring proper quoting:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

###############################
# reads all reservations and uses the current time to determine
# which reservations are active, then it updates the authorized
# users file on the target machines.
###############################
echo "Running on-rsvp-change.sh script"

# First define required environment variables if not set
: "${ADMIN_USER_ON_SWITCH:=admin}"
: "${SSH_RESERVATIONS_CONFIG_ON_SWITCH:=/etc/ssh/reservations.conf}"

# Get current timestamp
NOW=$(date +%s)

# Process reservations file
tail -n +2 ./.data/reservations.csv | while IFS=, read -r id user target from_date to_date rest; do
    # Convert dates to timestamps
    FROM=$(date -d "$from_date" +%s 2>/dev/null)
    TO=$(date -d "$to_date" +%s 2>/dev/null)
    
    # Skip invalid dates
    [ -z "$FROM" ] || [ -z "$TO" ] && continue
    
    # Check if reservation is active
    if [ "$NOW" -le "$TO" ] && [ "$NOW" -ge "$FROM" ]; then
        TARGET="${target}.polito.it"
        echo "Active reservation found: $user on $TARGET until $(date -d "@$TO")"
        
        # Debug output
        echo "User: $user, Expires: $TO"
        echo "Connecting to $TARGET..."
        
        # Test SSH connection
        ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 $ADMIN_USER_ON_SWITCH@$TARGET "echo 'Connection test successful'" || {
            echo "Failed to connect to $TARGET" >&2
            continue
        }
        
        # Uncomment to enable reservation updates
        # echo "$user,$TO" | ssh $ADMIN_USER_ON_SWITCH@$TARGET "
        #     sudo tee $SSH_RESERVATIONS_CONFIG_ON_SWITCH > /dev/null && 
        #     sudo /usr/local/bin/enforce-ssh-access.sh"
    fi
done
```

## Key Fixes:

1. Replaced complex AWK parsing with more reliable `while IFS=, read` loop
2. Added error checking and default values for variables
3. Fixed the date handling to prevent quoting issues
4. Added timeout for SSH connections to prevent hanging
5. Improved error reporting

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x deploy/docker/on-rsvp-change.sh
```

This version should resolve the syntax errors and provide better logging for troubleshooting.

alessandrocornacchia: it worked. But what error in the awk syntax?

GitHub Copilot: # AWK Syntax Error Explanation

The error in the AWK command was with the nested quotes in the date commands:

```bash
"date -d \"" $4 "\" +%s" | getline from
"date -d \"" $5 "\" +%s" | getline to
```

## What Caused the Error

AWK executes shell commands by enclosing them in double quotes, but when those commands themselves need quotes (like date strings), it creates nested quoting that can break in subtle ways:

1. The escaped quotes (`\"`) inside an already quoted string can be interpreted incorrectly
2. AWK might not properly close the command string if quotes aren't properly balanced
3. Different shell environments may handle these escape sequences differently

## Proper AWK Syntax

A more reliable approach is:

```bash
cmd = "date -d " $4 " +%s"
cmd | getline from
close(cmd)
```

Or simply avoiding AWK for date parsing altogether, which is why the fixed script used a pure Bash approach with direct command substitution.

The solution bypassed AWK's quoting complexities by processing the CSV file directly with Bash's built-in parsing capabilities.

GitHub Copilot: # SSH Command to Update Reservations Explained

This snippet from on-rsvp-change.sh is responsible for remotely updating switch access controls when a reservation becomes active:

```bash
echo "$user,$TO" | ssh $ADMIN_USER_ON_SWITCH@$TARGET "
            sudo tee $SSH_RESERVATIONS_CONFIG_ON_SWITCH > /dev/null && 
            sudo $ENFORCE_SSH_ACCESS_RESERVATION_SCRIPT_ON_SWITCH"
```

## Breaking it down:

1. **Create user data**: `echo "$user,$TO"` formats the user's name and expiration timestamp as a comma-separated string

2. **Pipe to SSH**: The `|` pipes this data to an SSH command that connects to the target switch

3. **SSH to the target**: `ssh $ADMIN_USER_ON_SWITCH@$TARGET` establishes a connection to the target machine using the admin credentials

4. **Update configuration file**: The remote commands (in quotes) first use `sudo tee` to write the user information to a configuration file:
   - `sudo tee $SSH_RESERVATIONS_CONFIG_ON_SWITCH > /dev/null` writes the data with elevated privileges
   - The `> /dev/null` suppresses output for clean logging

5. **Apply changes**: `sudo $ENFORCE_SSH_ACCESS_RESERVATION_SCRIPT_ON_SWITCH` runs a script on the target machine that reads the updated config file and applies the access controls

This approach allows the reservation system to dynamically grant SSH access to switches based on active reservations.

alessandrocornacchia: why the command seeems not to exit? I do  not receive any print after..

GitHub Copilot: # SSH Command Hanging Issue

Your script is likely hanging because the SSH command is waiting indefinitely for a connection or authentication. There are two main issues:

## Issues:

1. **No timeout**: The SSH command doesn't have a timeout parameter, so it will wait forever
2. **Exit status confusion**: You're printing `$?` and then checking it again, but the second check is evaluating the exit code of the `echo` command, not SSH

## Solution:

```bash
# Add timeout to prevent hanging
STATUS=0
echo "$user,$TO" | ssh -o ConnectTimeout=10 $ADMIN_USER_ON_SWITCH@$TARGET "
    sudo tee $SSH_RESERVATIONS_CONFIG_ON_SWITCH > /dev/null && 
    sudo $ENFORCE_SSH_ACCESS_RESERVATION_SCRIPT_ON_SWITCH" || STATUS=$?

# Check status without the echo that was overwriting it
if [ $STATUS -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Failed to connect to $TARGET (exit code: $STATUS)" >&2
    # Don't exit 1 here - that would terminate the whole script
    # on first failure and prevent processing other reservations
else
    echo "Successfully updated reservation for $user on $TARGET"
fi
```

The key fixes:
1. Added `-o ConnectTimeout=10` to prevent indefinite hanging
2. Saved the exit status to a variable instead of printing and then checking it
3. Removed the `exit 1` which would terminate the entire script on first failure
4. Added better error messaging with the actual exit code

This should ensure your script continues processing and provides proper feedback.

alessandrocornacchia: #terminalSelection  seems that execution of #file:on-rsvp-change.sh over ssh is randomic. Sometimes content is printed, sometimes not..

GitHub Copilot: # SSH Command Execution Is Inconsistent

Based on your terminal output, I see the issue with inconsistent results from the SSH command. This is a common problem with SSH operations in scripts.

## Causes of Inconsistent SSH Behavior

1. **Buffering issues**: SSH output might be buffered and not immediately flushed
2. **SSH connection timing**: Each connection attempt has variable latency
3. **Remote script execution**: The remote script runs with variable timing
4. **No error handling**: The current script doesn't capture or report errors

## Solution to Make SSH Output More Consistent

```bash
# Replace the existing SSH command with this more robust version
echo "Attempting SSH connection to $TARGET..."
if echo "$user,$(date -d "@$TO")" | ssh -o ConnectTimeout=10 -o BatchMode=yes $ADMIN_USER_ON_SWITCH@$TARGET "
    sudo tee $SSH_RESERVATIONS_CONFIG_ON_SWITCH &&
    sudo $ENFORCE_SSH_ACCESS_RESERVATION_SCRIPT_ON_SWITCH
    echo 'SSH command completed successfully'" > /tmp/ssh_output 2>&1; then
    echo "Successfully updated reservation for $user on $TARGET"
    cat /tmp/ssh_output
else
    echo "Error connecting to $TARGET (exit code: $?)"
    echo "Output was:"
    cat /tmp/ssh_output
fi
```

This implementation:
1. Adds a timeout to prevent indefinite hanging
2. Captures both stdout and stderr
3. Adds explicit output when the remote command completes
4. Shows more useful error messages
5. Uses BatchMode to avoid password prompts that might halt execution

These changes should make the SSH operation more consistent and provide better visibility into what's happening.

alessandrocornacchia: Write a documentation README inside #folder:docker  to say how one could deploy this either by a docker compose file or with plain docker. Remember for this to work people have to define some environmental variables accoding to #file:start.sh  and #file:on-rsvp-change.sh . Please explaoin this in a README

GitHub Copilot: # Docker Deployment Guide for Tofino RSVP Webapp

This guide explains how to deploy the Tofino Reservation System using either Docker Compose or plain Docker commands.

## Overview

The application consists of:
- A Flask web application for managing Tofino switch reservations
- A file watcher that automatically updates switch access when reservations change
- SSH connections to target switches to grant/revoke user access

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables should be configured:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DEBUG` | Enable Flask debugging mode | not set |
| `ADMIN_USER_ON_SWITCH` | Username for SSH access to switches | `admin` |
| `SSH_RESERVATIONS_CONFIG_ON_SWITCH` | Path to reservation config on switches | `/etc/ssh/reservations.conf` |
| `ENFORCE_SSH_ACCESS_RESERVATION_SCRIPT_ON_SWITCH` | Script on switches to enforce access permissions | *no default* |

## SSH Requirements

The container needs SSH access to the target switches. You should:

1. Generate SSH keys inside the container or mount your existing keys
2. Configure the target switches to accept these keys
3. Ensure the switches can be reached on the network

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  webapp:
    build:
      context: ..
      dockerfile: deploy/docker/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ../web:/app/web
      - ../.data:/app/web/.data
      - ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh:ro
    environment:
      - DEBUG=1
      - ADMIN_USER_ON_SWITCH=admin
      - SSH_RESERVATIONS_CONFIG_ON_SWITCH=/etc/ssh/reservations.conf
      - ENFORCE_SSH_ACCESS_RESERVATION_SCRIPT_ON_SWITCH=/usr/local/bin/enforce-ssh-access.sh
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Deploy with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Option 2: Plain Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t tofino-rsvp-webapp -f deploy/docker/Dockerfile .

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name tofino-rsvp \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -v "$(pwd)/web:/app/web" \
  -v "$(pwd)/.data:/app/web/.data" \
  -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh:ro \
  -e DEBUG=1 \
  -e ADMIN_USER_ON_SWITCH=admin \
  -e SSH_RESERVATIONS_CONFIG_ON_SWITCH=/etc/ssh/reservations.conf \
  -e ENFORCE_SSH_ACCESS_RESERVATION_SCRIPT_ON_SWITCH=/usr/local/bin/enforce-ssh-access.sh \
  tofino-rsvp-webapp
```

## Development Mode

For development with hot-reloading:

```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml
services:
  webapp:
    # ... other settings as above
    volumes:
      - ..:/app
    environment:
      - DEBUG=1
      # ... other environment variables
```

## Troubleshooting

- **SSH Connection Issues**: Check SSH keys permissions and network connectivity
- **Permissions Errors**: Ensure the container has access to the mounted volumes
- **Missing Data**: Make sure `.data` directory exists with proper permissions

## Monitoring

Access the application at http://localhost:8080

View logs with:
```bash
docker logs tofino-rsvp
# or with compose
docker compose logs webapp


alessandrocornacchia: ok, but change option 2 with saying people to use a .env file instead of this manual docker run

SSH_RESERVATIONS_CONFIG_ON_SWITCH=/etc/ssh/reservations.conf
ENFORCE_SSH_ACCESS_RESERVATION_SCRIPT_ON_SWITCH=/usr/local/bin/enforce-ssh-access.sh
```

Deploy with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Option 2: Plain Docker with Environment File

First, create a `.env` file with your configuration:

```
DEBUG=1
ADMIN_USER_ON_SWITCH=admin
SSH_RESERVATIONS_CONFIG_ON_SWITCH=/etc/ssh/reservations.conf
ENFORCE_SSH_ACCESS_RESERVATION_SCRIPT_ON_SWITCH=/usr/local/bin/enforce-ssh-access.sh
```

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t tofino-rsvp-webapp -f deploy/docker/Dockerfile .

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name tofino-rsvp \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -v "$(pwd)/web:/app/web" \
  -v "$(pwd)/.data:/app/web/.data" \
  -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh:ro \
  --env-file .env \
  tofino-rsvp-webapp
```
